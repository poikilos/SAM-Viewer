For now this assumes you are using some sane linux distro and have
a c++11 compliant compiler, although I am pretty sure it could be
made to work on any platform or device that meets the requirements.

**Requirements:** cmake, opengl, Irrlicht
```
cmake .
make -j2
```

**CMake options:** (defaults)
```
IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/irrlicht
IRRLICHT_LIBRARY="/usr/local/lib/libIrrlicht.so"
```

```
cmake . -DIRRLICHT_LIBRARY="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libIrrlicht.so"
